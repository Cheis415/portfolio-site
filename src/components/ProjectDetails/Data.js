	description: `Clever Counsel is a  production app that I worked on as an intern. It uses a React 
  front-end, a Flask back-end, and a MySQL database. This app automates a lot of the
  process of filing wage disputes for lawyers and their clients, saving them time and money. I learned what it takes
  to work for a company day-to-day as a developer, merging several pull requests, collaborating with a diverse team,
  and working in a Git workflow. I particulary loved working on this project, using  my skills to be of service
  to people in need.`,

  like or dislike a post, add friends, write posts and comments. We also put in a spotify widget so a user can bump their speakers while browsing. A postgreSQL database handles all the data

	description: `MicroBlog was built with React using Redux for state management. This is a purely 
  front-end App. A user can post and delete a blog post, as well as like other blogs. I also used 
  history.push to save blog posts to local storage and to leave likes. 
  I enjoyed the challenge of writing a front-end only app, but having it feel fully featured.
